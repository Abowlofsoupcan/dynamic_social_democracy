= <span style="color: #2C517A;">**DNVP**</span> Congress

A leadership vote is being held at the <span style="color: #2C517A;">German National People's Party</span>(<span style="color: #2C517A;">**DNVP**</span>) congress following the resignation of former leader Kuno von Westarp. The in-fighting resulting from their electoral defeat last election, coupled with the question of governmental participation in a system they're fundamentally opposed to has come to a head at this congress.

On the right is Alfred Hugenberg, a prominent industrialist and head of a media empire. He is vehemently opposed by the left of the party for his "<i>Katastrophenpolitik</i>", as he prefers to see the republic fall than participate in parliamentary government. With Westarp's refusal to run for re-election, despite urgent pleas from the moderates within the party, they have convinced the reluctant Oskar Hergt, former leader of the DNVP from 1918â€”1924, himself ousted by the right. The results of this congress may very well be a turning point in the history of the entire German nation.
