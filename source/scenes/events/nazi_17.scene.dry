= [+ nsdap_chancellor +] appointed Chancellor!

The moment has arrived—[+ nsdap_chancellor +] is set to be sworn in as Chancellor today, unless it's struck down at the last minute.

In response to rumors of a Schleicher coup, General von Blomberg is sworn in unconstitutionally by President Hindenburg in the early hours of the morning.

Hugenberg arrives at Papen's apartment, accompanied by the leaders of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>. They are met by an agitated Papen, who stresses the urgency of the situation.

The co-leader of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>, alongside Otto Schmidt-Hannover of the [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>?], expresses serious reservations about [+ nsdap_chancellor +]'s chancellorship.

Duesterberg's consent is crucial for his co-leader Seldte to enter the cabinet, but Duesterberg, having been targeted by <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> attacks due to his <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jewish</span> ancestry, remains deeply wary of a [+ nsdap_chancellor +] government.

Noticing his concerns, [+ nsdap_chancellor +] immediately approaches Duesterberg, assuring him that the attacks were never approved by him, and with a display of sincere emotion, Duesterberg relents, dropping his objections.

Not yet. With the swearing-in of the cabinet only minutes away, a loose end begins to unravel.

Hugenberg, being unaware of Papen's promise to [+ nsdap_leader +] that elections would immediately be called, was taken aback by [+ nsdap_chancellor +] requesting a commitment on that point, and firmly refused to accept [+ nsdap_leader +]'s demand.

With Hugenberg uncompromising as ever, no matter what is conceded to him, his arrogance has actually paid off this time. Not until Meissner interrupts, and Hugenberg, seeing himself as the only obstacle, accedes to new elections.

In an act of perjury, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leader swore to defend and uphold the constitution and laws of the republic he had so long vowed to destroy.

With Hindenburg believing that he was appointing a parliamentary chancellor, he ordered negotiations with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>, which were purposefully sabotaged and ultimately failed.

What do we do?

Although the arch-enemy of democracy had been installed as chancellor, to everyone's surprise, the usual political violence marked that day. The <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> parties haven't had the expected reaction to his appointment, and many believe that we should bide our time and prepare for a final showdown when [+ nsdap_chancellor +] likely violates the constitution. Many also believe that Hindenburg will keep [+ nsdap_chancellor +] in check, and save German democracy from destruction.

Most people have no idea what has befallen them; the installation of yet another chancellor had become such a common occurrence that a dangerous amount of ordinary folk have grown indifferent.

This astonishing turnabout in [+ nsdap_leader +]'s fortunes confirmed his belief that he was a man of destiny, certain to succeed in his plan to purify Germany of <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span>, and wage endless wars of violent expansion all over Europe. Hitler had not seized power; it had been handed to him by the men who at that moment controlled Germany’s destiny.

What are we to do now?

= Enabling Act

Together with the [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if dnf_formed: <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>?], and the dictatorial powers offered by the Reichstag Fire Decree, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> have won more than an outright majority.

The law is considered a constitutional amendment, requiring two-thirds of the Reichstag to approve the bill. The <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> are de-facto banned, and many <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> deputies are imprisoned under the powers of the Reichstag Fire Decree. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> is the deciding factor, seeking to save the Catholic population from persecution and a second Kulturkampf.

<span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> men are positioned inside and outside the chamber, an intense atmosphere of fear settling over the nominally constitutional <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>. Wirth and Brüning argue against the bill, while the majority of the party is in favor of it. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have promised constitutional safeguards, but have refused to put it in writing as requested by Hugenberg and the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>.

- @enabling_act_2: The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> votes for the enabling act!

subtitle: It doesn't matter in the end.

A concordat with the Vatican is signed months later, protecting the millions of German Catholics from potential <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> persecution. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> becomes the sole political party. Franz von Papen is ousted from Prussia, remaining in the powerless position of Vice Chancellor. Hugenberg is forced to resign.

Efforts to tame the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have failed; their relentless consolidation of power leaves only the aging Hindenburg to check their unlimited authority. Schleicher is murdered during the Night of Long Knives, Papen delivers his infamous 'Marburg Speech' before resigning, and after Hindenburg’s death at 86 years old, Germany is lost.
