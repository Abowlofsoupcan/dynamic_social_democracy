= <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> Party Conference

Now is the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s national party conference, where they will choose their new leadership. The shadow of the Wittorf Affair hangs over it. On one hand are the hardline supporters of Th채lmann, who support a "<span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>" policy that places the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> as equivalent to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. On the other hand is the "Conciliator" faction, who support a more cooperative policy towards the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

After our discussion with the <span style="color: #940000;">Soviets</span>, we are inclined to believe that <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalin</span> is at least open to the Conciliators. In order to affect the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s leadership elections, we have to influence both the <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span> leaders as as well as the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> membership.

With our support, and Stalin's blind eye, the Conciliators have won the leadership contest! Thalmann has been expelled from the Party Leadership, and takes a more secondary role. 
For now, Ernst Meyer has been elected leader of the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> by the Concilators and the Right Opposition. Relations with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> are likely to improve, as they have recieved permisson from the <span style="color: #940000;">Soviets</span> to take on a more cooperative stance towards us, thanks to our good relations with <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalin</span>.
However. <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalin</span>'s paranoia escapes no one. If we compromise too much with the bourgousie, we may find ourselves on <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalin</span>'s bad side, and he may return Th채lmann to power once more.

Unfortunately, we could not influence the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> leadership election against the hardliners. Th채lmann quickly moves to consolidate absolute leadership, expelling or exiling his opponents.
