Gustav Stresemann, leader of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, has died. He was the primary force driving the party to support democracy; without him, the democratic forces in the Republic will be so much weaker. This has also weakened his party to a significant degree, perhaps the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> will start and end with him.
