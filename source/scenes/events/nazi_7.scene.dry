= The End of Gregor Strasser

With any hope of a political comeback shattered, Gregor Strasser has finally retired from public life. It’s likely that he abandoned any thought of challenging [+ nsdap_leader +] long ago, if he ever entertained such an idea. The former pharmacist from a small Bavarian town simply lacks the ego and desire for power necessary to confront the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leader.

In a brief meeting with Göring, Strasser agreed to withdraw from all political activity for two years and return to his previous profession as a pharmacist.

Meanwhile, Schleicher remains trapped in a dangerous delusion—that [+ nsdap_leader +] will act like a conventional party leader and offer concessions to maintain unity. He has done no such thing.
