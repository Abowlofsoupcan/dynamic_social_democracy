= Snap Elections Called

Chancellor Schleicher and the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span> now see an opportunity to dramatically boost their seat share in fresh electionsâ€”paving the way to consolidate power and govern outright with only the loyal <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span>, free from parliamentarianism.

New Reichstag elections are scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +], Week [+ next_election_week +].
