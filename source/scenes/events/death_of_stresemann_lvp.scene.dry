At the age of fifty-one, Germanyâ€™s leading <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberal</span> statesman had died. He was the primary force driving the right of the party to support democracy; without him, the democratic forces in the Republic will be so much weaker. 

A hole has been left within the liberal movement at the worse possible time, and it is likely that the industrial and business wing of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> will complete their takeover and subsequently end cooperation with us.
