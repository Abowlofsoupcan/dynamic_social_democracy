@government
go-to: menu

The German Republic, called by some of our detractors as the "Weimar Republic", is a parliamentary republic with a somewhat weak president and a strong parliament, called the Reichstag. The Reichstag is responsible for governing, while the President has a largely ceremonial role but also has some important governing responsibilities.

The Reichstag is elected based on a proportional representation system, giving parties seats roughly proportional to their vote share in each electoral district. The Reichstag then elects the Chancellor and the cabinet by a majority vote, who are responsible for government. A majority vote-of-no-confidence can remove the current government.

The President is elected by a national direct vote, in two rounds. The second round is used if the first round does not result in a majority for one candidate; the candidate who receives a plurality in the second round becomes president (there is no obligation for weaker candidates to drop out). The role of the president is mostly to represent Germany, but he also has some crucial governing powers. The president and chancellor can together use emergency decrees to govern, bypassing the Reichstag. The president can also appoint or remove a chancellor when a parliamentary majority is unable to be established, and can thus influence the formation of a government.

Germany is divided into a number of states, each of which have their own governments with some responsibilities. By far the largest and most important state is Prussia.

**Demographic Groups**

**Working Class**: The urban working class - blue-collar workers in factories, workshops, mines, and the like. Most are <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>, supporting either the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> or <span style="color: #7A2B5C;">**KPD**</span>. They make up 40-50% of the population.

**Old Mittelstand**: The old middle class consists of independent artisans, shopkeepers, and small-time businesspeople. They tend to be conservative and are the strongest base for the <span style="color: #2C517A;">far</span>-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">right</span>. 10-15% of the population.

**New Mittelstand**: The new middle class consists of white-collar workers and government employees. This is the base of <span style="color: #E1D85D;">liberalism</span>. 10-15% of the population.

**Rural**: Small and large farmers and independent rural workers. [? if rural_dnvp_normalized > rural_nsdap_normalized: Protestant farmers usually supports the <span style="color: #2C517A;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if rural_nsdap_normalized >= 25: Protestant farmers usually supports the <span style="color: #2C517A;">**DNVP**</span>, however the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**Nazis**</span> have gained a strong appeal among them?]. 20-30% of the population.

**Catholics** are the largest religious minority, at about 30% of the population. They disproportionately support the <span style="color: #000000;">**Center Party**</span> (or the <span style="color: #4B758B;">**Bavarian People's Party**</span> in <span style="color: #00CCFF;">Bavaria</span>).

**Jews** account for between 0.5% to 1% of the population, and tend to support liberal parties, [? if ddp_name == "DDP": mostly the DDP?][? if ddp_name == "DStP": although the mild antisemitism of the Young German Order and it's association with the DStP has driven them away?], although substantial numbers support the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> or <span style="color: #7A2B5C;">**KPD**</span>.
