= Coalition Affairs

Our coalition is in trouble. The right-leaning members of the <span style="color: #000000;">**Center**</span> [? if in_grand_coalition: and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> ?] are constantly criticizing us for our policies, and are threatening to call a vote of no confidence to collapse this government[? if spd_prussia :, or to do the same for our government in the state of Prussia ?].

How do we reduce tensions with the coalition?

- @dvp_prussia_2: Let the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> into Prussia.
- @promise_cuts: Agree to the bourgeois plans to cut welfare.
- @resources: Use our party resources to support our allies.
- @bring_down: Instead, we will bring down the government with a no-confidence vote, and call for new elections.
- @no_change: Take none of these actions.
- @easy_discard

Letting the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> into the Prussian government is an offer too good for them to refuse, no matter their leadership. 

However, this has negatively impacted our freedom of action we previously had in the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> coalition.

Fine. By cutting welfare, we have reduced dissent within the coalition.

@resources
subtitle: -2 resources
view-if: historical_mode = 0
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough resources (need 2).
choose-if: resources >= 2
on-arrival: resources -= 2; coalition_dissent -= 1

By transferring campaign funds to our coalition partners, we can make our policies more acceptable to them. Some would call this corruption, but perhaps it is necessary to save democracy.

@no_change

No. We will not do this.

@bring_down

We have called for a vote of no confidence in ourselves, and have brought down this government. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] currently rules as acting chancellor.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
